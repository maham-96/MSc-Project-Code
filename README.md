This code was written by Maham Ahmad (maham88@hotmail.co.uk) for the purpose of validating antibody-based drug
descriptions.

## Validation code for correct domain types:
This code is a section of the main programme (Validator programme). It is used for:

### Correct domain types (and can be used for incorrect domain interaction file).

Correct domain type file has a variety of possible domains that can be deemed correct; they use same interaction 
numbers multiple times so the interaction match (i.e(1:2) and (2:1), domain 1 matching with domain 2 and domain 
2 matching with domain 1) is not taken into account. This part of the code is for testing purposes only.

## Validator programme:
The is the main programme used to test the

####
correct domain and interactions file
####
incorrect domains and interactions file

This programme looks for correct domain types as well as correct interaction matches (i.e (1:2) and (2:1), domain 1
matches with domain 2 and domain 2 matches with domain 1).
